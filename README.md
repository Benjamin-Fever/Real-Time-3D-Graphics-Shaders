<h1>Real Time 3D Graphics Shaders</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This a project made for one of my computer graphics courses. In this we were tasked with generating 3D shapes my altering the vertices.
The first shape was a sphere generated by using spherical coordinates and converting those into cartesian coordinates.
The second is a sphere using another method where you generate a cube first and then normalize it.
 The third was a torus that used similar method to generating the first sphere.

 The second section of the task was to create a BDRF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) shader and also calculate UV's for wrapping a texture around the shapes and applying a height map.
